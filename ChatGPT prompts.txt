1.

I have a class with function defined in financials.py and I'm building a streamlit app to display information on different pages.

The structure is as follows:

GP2
|-financials.py
|-pages
       |-plot.py

I'm trying to call financials.py in plot.py using import financials, but it's not recognizing it


2.
My Date column on PRI was a string of dates: '2019-04-11'. I called Pri=PRI.with_columns(pl.col('Date').str.to_datetime('%Y-%m-%d')) but it's giving it back to me with hours, which I don't want. How can I enforce to have only dates?
